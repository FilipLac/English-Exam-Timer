## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can submit a Issue if there is any problem/vulnerability that I should be aware of. Any report will be taken care of :)

Because I still study, updates won't be that frequent (unless it is serious vulnerability, or issue preventing user from using this program). Any proggress updates will be tracked here on projects board and/or in issues tab.

If there is new release, it might get posted in readme (if there is some serious bug/issue/vulnerabily) and also it will be posted in releases tab with version that patches/fixes it.
